# Protocol Oriented Login Manager in Swift

This is a example of how to implement a system of multiples logins with Swift in iOS.
Iâ€™m trying to use the Protocol Oriented paradigm as much as possible.

Login With Facebook
Login With Google
Login Native

LoginGoogleManager and LoginFacebookManager implements the protocol Login.
SignViewController implements the protocol Loggable.
